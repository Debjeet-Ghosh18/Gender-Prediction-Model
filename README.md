## Gender Prediction
A simple machine learning web application built with Streamlit that predicts a person's gender based on their height and weight.

The application uses a simple machine learning classification model to predict whether a person is Male or Female based on their height and weight. The dataset usually contains numeric values for height (cm), weight (kg), and the target label (gender).


Model Training
A classification algorithm is trained (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or SVM).
Features: Height, Weight
Target: Gender
