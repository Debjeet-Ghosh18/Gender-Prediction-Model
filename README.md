## Gender Prediction Web App

A machine learning web application built with Streamlit that predicts a personâ€™s gender based on their height and weight.

ðŸ“Š How It Works

The application uses a classification model trained on a dataset containing:

Features: Height (cm), Weight (kg)

Target: Gender (Male / Female)

The model learns patterns from the data and predicts gender for new inputs.

ðŸ›  Model Training

A machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or SVM) is trained.

The trained model is saved using Pickle for deployment.

ðŸ’» Streamlit Application

User-friendly UI with input fields for height and weight.

User enters their values.

The app loads the trained model.

The model predicts gender â†’ result is displayed instantly on the screen.
