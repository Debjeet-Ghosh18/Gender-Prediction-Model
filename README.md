## Gender Prediction Web App

A machine learning web application built with Streamlit that predicts a personâ€™s gender based on their height and weight.
ðŸ“Š How It Works

The application uses a classification model trained on a dataset containing:

Features: Height (cm), Weight (kg)

Target: Gender (Male / Female)

The model learns patterns from the data and predicts gender for new inputs.


ðŸ›  Model Training

A machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or SVM) is trained.

The trained model is saved using Pickle for deployment.
